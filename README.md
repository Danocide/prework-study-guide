## Usage

In this webpage I learned the basics for HTML as shown in the structuring of the page with the header, body, and footer of the webpage. Using CSS I was able to change and personalize the page to make it easier to see, read, and clearly distinguish the different parts of the webpage.
When opening DevTools console we can see the javascript running with the different peramiters set, giving a guide of what to do.
